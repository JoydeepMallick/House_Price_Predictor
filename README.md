# FIRST_PROJECT_MACHINE_Learning

My first ever project on Machine Learning. Created a machine learning model using linear regression and then ported it to a pickle file to be used in flask application to predict house price. 

I have deployed the project on Heroku. CLick on the link below to check it out.
